#### Bio ####

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Zymergen. Previously, I was a
postdoctoral fellow in the lab of [Nils Gehlenborg](http://gehlenborg.com/) at
Harvard Medical School and before that a PhD student working on modelling the
tertiary structure of RNA molecules at the [Theoretical Biochemistry
Group](http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at) at the University of Vienna. If you're
interested, you can find a slightly outdated short form copy of my <a
href="/cv">CV here</a> or take a look at <a
